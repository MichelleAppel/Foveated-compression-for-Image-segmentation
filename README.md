# Foveated Compression in Image Segmentation for Phosphene Vision

## Overview and Project Goals

This repository hosts an experimental project aimed at exploring the use of foveated image processing for edge detection in the context of visual prosthetics. It builds upon the methodologies found in the `dynaphos` and `fovperi` projects, seeking to advance the simulation and application of cortical prosthetic vision and biologically inspired deep learning models for visual perception.

The primary goal of this project is to integrate and adapt techniques from existing research to create a model that efficiently processes visual information. By applying foveated compression, the model aims to reduce computational load while maintaining high-quality edge detection for use in visual prosthetics. This could lead to more effective and accessible solutions for individuals relying on prosthetic vision.
